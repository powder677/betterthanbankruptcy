            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Collapse Point</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               I was a mid-level Project Manager, comfortable in the routine of corporate deadlines and bi-weekly paychecks. Then, the layoff happened. At first, there was optimism—I had a resume, I had experience. But as the severance package dwindled, the optimism turned into a cold, hard knot in my stomach.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               Applying for jobs felt like sending paper airplanes into a black hole. The "Thank you for your application" auto-replies weren't going to pay the rent, and the hiring timeline for corporate roles was moving far too slowly to outrun my dwindling savings.
            </p>
         </section>

         <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Pivot Idea</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               Necessity forced a change in perspective. I realized I didn't have time to interview for a "career." I needed to sell a specific solution to a specific problem, right now.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               I stopped trying to sell my entire work history and started selling a specific outcome I could deliver in two weeks. Instead of asking for a job and a salary, I started asking former colleagues if they had backlog projects that needed clearing—offering to invoice them as a contractor.
            </p>

         <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Friction</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               It wasn't a smooth transition. I drastically underpriced my first three contracts because I was desperate for a "yes." I didn't know how to structure an invoice properly, and I felt incredibly awkward—almost "cheap"—asking for money directly rather than receiving it from a payroll department.
            </p>

         <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Toolset</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               I resisted the urge to buy expensive software or "look professional" with paid subscriptions. My stack was incredibly lean. I used a simple HTML invoice template, a standard Calendar app to block my time, and a separate checking account to ensure I didn't accidentally spend my tax withholdings on groceries.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               The only formal step I took was separating the money. I used the formation tools listed in <a href="/tools/business-formation.html" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 font-medium underline decoration-blue-200 underline-offset-4 transition">Business Formation</a> to ensure I was operating cleanly.

         <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Outcome</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               I am not rich, but I am stabilized. My cash flow is erratic compared to a W2 salary, but it is controllable. If I need more money, I increase my outreach volume.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               Currently, I have replaced about 80% of my previous salary, but I have gained 100% control of my time. I no longer fear a single manager telling me I am redundant.
            </p>

         <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-900 mt-12 mb-4">The Unresolved</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">
               It is important to be honest about the downsides. Taxes are still scary every quarter. There is no Paid Time Off (PTO); if I don't work, I don't eat. It is not a perfect system, but it is infinitely better than sitting by the phone waiting for a hiring manager to choose me.
            </p>
